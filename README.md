## Microsoft Utility Belt

Here is where I will be storing any scripts I create to make Administration of Microsoft products easier.

**This is an Administrator script and is intended to run with elevated permissions**

### Utility.ps1 - **work in progress**

#### Current Abilities

* Find Logged on User (RDP)
* Find Logged on User Anywhere (SLOW)

**I accept no responsibility for script missuse, Scripts can be damaging if not used properly**
